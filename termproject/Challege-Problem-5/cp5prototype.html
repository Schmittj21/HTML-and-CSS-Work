  <p id="p1"> My name is John Schmitt. In my free time I love to expierance the outdoors. I have hiked various mountains and trails
  in numerous places in the Southeast and even out West. Duirng sophmore year I got the chance to go skiing
  in Colorado, home of extreme skiing. Weather conditions were rough by did
  not negate out the fun of skiing. However, I still needed to find my true love for the outdoors.

     <h3>Hunting</h3>
  <p id="p2"> A year later, I was invited to Argentina to go dove hunting
    with friends. We shot for five days, leaving the evening aftera morning hunt. This trip marked the start of my love for
    hunting. In the evenings, we were met with an elaborate dinner. Somtimes this meant a smoked pig, doves fresh from the field,
    or some other variety of native Argentinian food, specifically form the Cordoba region.
